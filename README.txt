DESCRIPTION
-----------

Provides items that will show you how to craft any craftable or cookable item.

It works like this...
build a craft_guide:sign_wall using default:stick shaped like a question mark:
(X stick | - empty)
- X X
- X X
- X -      (ok, so a question mark isn't perfect in a 3x3)  =)

place the sign, then right click on it... it will open like a chest.

to move to next/prev pages, drop an item into the next/prev slots under the items

to see the recipe for an item, drop the item into the craft slot (single left slot)

you can bookmark items using the block on the right (remove from bookmarks with the single slot above)
