DESCRIPTION
-----------

Provides items that will show you how to craft any craftable or cookable item.

It works like this...
build a craft_guide:sign_wall using default:stick shaped like a question mark:
stick stick
stick stick
stick     

(ok, so a question mark isn't perfect in a 3x3)  =)

place the sign, then right click on it... it will open like a chest.

to see the recipe for an item, drop the item into the output slot

you can bookmark items using the block on the right
